## Current Snyppr issues

- Here are some bugs we are aware of:
  - If Snyppr signup is interrupted before you can make a Stripe account, you can't use that account because of the current routing logic.
  - Everytime you login after account creation, the page will hang on the `/newUser` endpoint (profile collection page). You have to refresh to get past it. 
  - Any post to the database does not trigger a rerender and will not be reflected in the UI until you refresh.
  - Sockets sent payment request to all connected channels instead of just one channel.
