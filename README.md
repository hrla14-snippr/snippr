# [Snyppr](https://github.com/hrla14-snippr/snippr)

Snyppr is a fullstack web applicaiton for getting on demand hair cuts. If you're the type of person that needs a hair cut, but hates having to schedule, travel, and wait to get a haircut, Snyppr has you covered. Just load up the app, find a barber that's 20 miles within your location, and then schedule an appointment.

## Quick start

When you run these commands in the Terminal, please don't include the $ dollar sign. It's just a coding convention to indicate what command should be entered into the Terminal.

- Clone the repo locally to your computer by entering the following command into the Terminal: `$ git clone https://github.com/hrla14-snippr/snippr`
- Make sure you have [npm](https://www.npmjs.com) installed.
- Once npm is installed, run the following commands in separate Terminal tabs:
  - `$ npm install` to install the npm dependencies in the `package.json` file. Please be patient, it'll take awhile to load the dependencies.
  - `$ npm start` to start the server on `localhost:3000`.
  - If you need seed/dummy data in your database, run `$ npm run seed`.

- Navigate to [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/) on your favorite web browser to be directed to the login page.
  - On the landing page to Snyppr, you'll have the option of either signing up as a Snyppr (a barber) or as a Snypee (a client that's looking for a haircut).
